                                  <p>Here are some other questions to think through and answer before you seek out insurance companies:</p>
                                  <p ><strong>Do you prefer to have lower monthly payments or lower deductibles?</strong></p>
                                  <p ><strong>Do you want to speak with the same agent each time you talk to your insurance company, or are you okay being assigned a new person with each new claim?</strong></p>
                                  <p ><strong>What types of auto insurance do you need?</strong></p>
                                  <p ><strong>Those types include liability, collision, comprehensive, personal injury, uninsured motorist, and more. How much can you afford to pay for car insurance?</strong></p>

                                  <p>Once you have a good idea of what you need—and what you don’t need—from your car insurance policy, it’s time to see what insurance companies are willing to offer. Because make no mistake: rates and policies do differ from company to company, and sometimes even agent to agent.</p><br/>
                                  <p>Some of the policy decisions will be outside of your control. For example, each state has minimum coverage thresholds, which means you won’t be able to cut some types of insurance altogether, and there may be a certain amount of coverage you have to purchase in order to be legally insured in your state. Within those boundaries, however, there can be a lot of room for flexibility.</p>
